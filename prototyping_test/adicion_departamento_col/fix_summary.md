# Fix for Error on Line 68 in informe_mensual_data.py

## Issue Description
There was an error on line 68 in the `informe_mensual_data.py` file. The line was trying to import the `create_municipio_departamento_mapping` function from the `municipio_departamento_mapping` module, but it was not using the correct module path.

## Solution
The issue was fixed by updating the import statement to include the full module path:

```python
# Before:
from municipio_departamento_mapping import create_municipio_departamento_mapping

# After:
from prototyping_test.adicion_departamento_col.municipio_departamento_mapping import
    create_municipio_departamento_mapping
```

This change ensures that Python can correctly locate the module, which is in the `prototyping_test` directory.

## Testing
A test script was created to verify that the fix works correctly. The script imports the `data_integrity` function from `services.informe_mensual_data` and runs it. The test was successful, confirming that the import statement now works correctly.

## Technical Details
The issue occurred because line 67 adds the `prototyping_test` directory to the Python path:

```python
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)), 'prototyping_test'))
```

But line 68 was trying to import directly from a module called `municipio_departamento_mapping` without specifying that it's in the `prototyping_test` package. By updating the import statement to include the full module path, we ensure that Python can correctly locate the module.
